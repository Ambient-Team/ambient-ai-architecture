# üåê Ambient Systems ML/AI Repository

## üéØ Mission & Role  
This repository powers **Ambient Systems' core AI capabilities**, bridging **classic machine learning** (1980s‚Äì1990s) and **modern generative AI** (2020s+). It builds on the [Ambient-Systems-DSA](https://github.com/Ambient-Team/Ambient-Systems-DSA) foundation and delivers **open-source, Python-based frameworks** for scalable industry applications.

Use cases span **smart infrastructure**, **vertical farming**, **finance**, **sustainability**, and **cloud-native AI deployments**. Ideal for developers, researchers, and enterprise adopters.
